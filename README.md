### Stream Discharge Calculation

**Need for this App**  :thought_balloon: 

Stream Cross-Sections are irregular in shape and highly dynamic in nature which makes manual calculation of **Wetted Area** and **Wetted Perimeter** with fluctuation of water depth a tedious task.  

This App is intended to simplify this task by making use of Interpolation and Numerical Methods in Python and then calculate **Velocity** and **Discharge** of the stream for different input parameters.
