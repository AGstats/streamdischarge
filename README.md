### Stream Discharge Calculation
**:violet[Need for this App]  :thought_balloon:**  
        Stream Cross-Sections are irregular in shape and highly dynamic in nature which makes manual calculation of **Wetted Area** and **Wetted Perimeter** with fluctuation of water depth a tedious task.  
        \n  This App is intended to Simplify this task by making use of Interpolation Techniques and Numerical Methods in Python and then calculate **Velocity** and **Discharge** of the stream for different input parameters.
